It is assumed that the operation is always done on `quotes.txt`. So it is hardcoded into the code.

```

```

This will print `quotes.txt` without blank lines and duplicates.

### Q2.

``` 
$ ./q2.sh 
```
This will take input from `quotes.txt` and modifies the text and stores it in `speech.txt`.

$ ./q3.sh
```

The sorted list is printed with space as delimiter.

### Q5.
